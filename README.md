### Scraping Rules

* You should check a websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions before you scrape it. Be careful to read the statements about legal use of data. Usually, the data you scrape should not be used for commercial purposes.
* Do not request data from the website too aggressively with your program (also known as spamming), as this may break the website. Make sure your program behaves in a reasonable manner (i.e. acts like a human). One request for one webpage per second is good practice.
* The layout of a website may change from time to time, so make sure to revisit the site and rewrite your code as needed
